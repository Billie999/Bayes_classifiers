# Bayes_classifiers
 Real-world application of classifiers may require that the predictors used for classification be physically measured and, hence, the inclusion of unnecessary predictors may incur additional costs associated with sensors, instruments and computing. It should be noted that some variables may even require human intervention and/or expensive laboratory analyses in order to be measured. It is important that analysts try to use as few predictors as possible, that is, the smallest set of predictors that are relevant for the classification task in hand and yet sufficient to provide satisfactory classification performance. Selecting predictors is an important task called feature selection in data mining.
